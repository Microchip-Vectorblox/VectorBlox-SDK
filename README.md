# VectorBlox SDK

VectorBlox is an SDK for compiling and running TFLITE INT8 models on the VectorBlox accelerator.

Models must be quantized, then compiled via the included scripts.  

The models can then be ran via the VectorBlox simulator, or on a physical VectorBlox accelerator.

## Quickstart 

### Prerequisites

 To use the VectorBlox SDK, you will need run the SDK in an Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, or 24.04 environment.
 If using WSL, ensure you are running from your home directory or have permissions set.

> If cloning the repo, `git` and `git-lfs` must be installed via `apt install git-lfs && git-lfs install`

### Download the SDK

There are two options for downloading the SDK:

 1) Download an archive (zip or tar.gz) from https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SDK/releases
     
 2) Clone this repository
     
### Install dependencies (done once, requires sudo permission)

Navigate to the root directory of `VectorBlox-SDK` and run the following commands:

```
bash install_dependencies.sh
```

### Activate (which installs if needed) Python3.10 virtual environment, and sets necessary environment variables
```
source setup_vars.sh
```

### Run Tutorials

Example tutorials are provided that generate CoreVectorBlox compatible binary files.

Tutorials will download the model and convert it to a quantized `.tflite` if necessary.
It will then be compiled into a VectorBlox binary file (`.vnnx` and `.hex` or `.ucomp` extensions) and simulated.

Follow the below steps to run a tutorial.

```bash 
cd $VBX_SDK/tutorials/SOURCE_NAME/MODEL_NAME
bash MODEL_NAME.sh
```



### Next Steps

Once a model's binary file has been obtained from the SDK, it can be run on the board. Currently the 3.0 SDK only supports the PolarFire SoC Video Kit.


Please refer to the Quickstart Guide in the [VectorBlox-SoC-Video-Kit-Demo](https://github.com/Microchip-Vectorblox/VectorBlox-SoC-Video-Kit-Demo/tree/main) GitHub repo for the quickest way to set up the board


Then refer to adding_models.md in the docs folder for instructions on adding the binary file generated by the SDK to the demo.
