## Documentation Index

### C API
[C_API](./C_API.md) contains the VectorBlox API calls used by C and C++ programmers.

### CoreVectorBlox v3.0 IP Handbook
This handbook provides details about the Microchip CoreVectorBlox environment and how to use it. This document is used by Microchip FPGA designers using Libero® System-on-Chip (SoC).

### CoreVectorBlox v3.0 Release Notes
Summary of key changes in the current release.

### Inference Simulation
[inference_simulation](./inference_simulation.md) provides instructions and example scripts for running classification, object detection, and pose detection models on the VBX simulator using both C and Python.

### Operators
[OPS](./OPS.md) lists the currently supported operators

### Postprocess
[postprocess](./postprocess.md) lists the currently supported postprocessing functions

### Resource Utilization
[resource_utilization](./resource_utilization.md) contains a table of PolarFire SoC resource utilization metrics for seven different size and compression configurations

### SDK Toolkit
[sdk_toolkit](./sdk_toolkit.md) outlines of the SDK toolkits used in the CoreVectorBlox flow for model conversion, detailing tools for handling OpenVINO, ONNX, and TensorFlow Lite formats. It provides an overview of each tool’s purpose, usage examples

### VBX Graph Generation
[vbx_graph_generation](./vbx_graph_generation.md) describes vnnx_compile tool converts a TF Lite model into a quantized binary file for that can be run on hardware. Currently, vnnx_compile supports {V250, V500, V1000} size configurations, and {no compression, compression, unstructured compression} compression configurations .
  
### VBX SDK Programmer's Guide
This VectorBloxPG provides details about Microchip VectorBlox Tool Flow environment, and it is used for converting neural networks and generating graphs, to accelerate inference on an FPGA using CoreVectorBlox IP. However, for the most updated information about the SDK please refer to this repo's markdown files
