# In PyTorch 1.7.0, torch.squeeze emits an If operation into the ONNX graph,
# which breaks the conversion of the midasnet model to IR. This change was made
# in <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/38476>.
# Later on, another change was made in <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/45369>,
# which might undo the effects of the first change. It's not yet been included in any
# release at the time of writing, so whether it helps, remains to be seen.
# For now, just cap the PyTorch version at 1.6.x.
